            <p>
                As a Content Developer at Madecraft and an Adjunct Professor at Westcliff University, I combine my passion for education and technology to create engaging and effective e-learning courses. I have a Master of Arts in Mathematics Teacher Education from Rutgers Graduate School of Education and a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Rutgers University. I have over five years of teaching experience in STEM subjects, including math and computer science. I have strong skills in learning strategies, communication, and e-learning, and I enjoy collaborating with other educators and content creators to deliver high-quality learning outcomes. My mission is to inspire and empower learners of all ages and backgrounds to achieve their academic and professional goals.
            <br></br>
                In my free time, I enjoy lifting weights, watching Netflix, and traveling. Currently, I am preparing for a bodybuilding competition in women's wellness division for early 2024.
